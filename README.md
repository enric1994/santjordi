In Catalonia (Spain), Saint Gerorge's day is one of the most original celebrations, book and flower stalls are set up along the streets of Barcelona 🌹📚

So I created a gamechat that explains the Saint George's story from the point of view of one the characters (🐮👸🏼🤴👑👨‍🌾🐲), in order to advance the users have to interact with other participants and find the next character that unlock his story. Let's see an example:

(Note that all the texts are in Catalan)

As you can see, to start the history you must start a conversation with the bot and text the keyword: **conte**.
Then, the bot explain the introduction of the history and assigns you a character (in this case the princess 👸🏼). To continue, the user need to find the king 👑 and attach the contact of that person:

Finally, to end the story, the princess must find the dragon 🐲
